Gumble - A wonderfull dating app. ü©∑


It is a dating application developed under the `MVVM` design architecture, the application allows us to make consumption of an `RESTful API` serially and concurrently through the `Combine framework`, the main screen will show a loader and then a person, with the buttons that are located at the bottom we can simulate whether we like or dislike the person and in turn, clicking on the image will show us the detail view to learn more about the current person.

In the upper right corner there is a button with the symbol of a star, when tapping on it, it will show us the featured people and in the same way, we can see the detail view of each one of them. 

It's possible to test RESTful API calls with `XCTest` bundle.
